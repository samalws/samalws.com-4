<p><b>A few projects I've worked on:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
  <a href="https://github.com/samalws/utlc-compiler">utlc-compiler</a> -
    A compiler for untyped lambda calculus, which outputs to Haskell or Rust (Rust output is very slow).
    Code is written entirely in untyped lambda calculus, with no primitive types.
    The IO system doesn't make use of any primitive types, either.
    Older versions are
